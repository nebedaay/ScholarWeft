# ZotLit Import Templates

In ScholarWeft's settings you can click **Install and use ScholarWeft's ZotLit import templates**. The templates are packaged in the plugin, so nothing is downloaded; they are written to `sw-zotlit-templates/` in your vault, which is set as your ZotLit template folder so your existing templates are left untouched.

The click also writes ScholarWeft's **frontmatter field mappings** into ZotLit's settings. ZotLit builds each note's frontmatter from its *settings*, not from the templates, so a template folder alone would not reproduce the imported properties — the mappings are what turn Zotero fields into the `title`, `authors`, `up`, `related`, and other properties the templates expect. ZotLit's previous settings are backed up as `data.json.scholarweft.bak` first.

The templates follow ScholarWeft's "link everything" philosophy and assume you curate your Zotero items and annotations with Obsidian in mind:

- All annotations appear in their original colour in callout boxes, so you can colour-code annotation types; each colour is linked to a colour note where you can explain its use and link onward.
- Zotero `tags` and `related` fields become links in the literature note's `related` property.
- `tags` in PDF-annotation comments also become links inside the comment callout.
- Existing wikilinks in annotation comments are preserved, so imported notes slot straight into your note network.
- Rectangular and ink annotations are imported as attachments and displayed as images.
- A comment beginning with `+` marks the highlighted text as a continuation of the previous highlight, appended after " … ", so you can combine quotes that span pages or parts of a longer passage.

Requires ZotLit (and Zotero). See [Literature Notes](./literature-notes.md) and [Dependencies](./dependencies.md).
