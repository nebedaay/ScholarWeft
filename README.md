# ScholarWeft

<img src="./images/scholarweft-illustration.png" width="300" alt="ScholarWeft logo">

Weaving your ideas, Obsidian, Zotero, and word processor output into a connected scholarly workflow. It integrates three processes:

- Importing and updating your Zotero citations and annotations into Obsidian as literature notes using a rich template
- Connecting your works cited to your universe of thoughts, treating them as Zotero links while formatting them as formatted citations
- Importing and exporting your scholarly writing while keeping active Zotero citations, using complex templates to produce publication-ready academic articles and books

ScholarWeft's unique **linked citations** format weaves every work you cite into your interconnected Obsidian thought universe. The citation `[[@sanchez2009|see @, p. 25]]` is simultaneously a formatted inline citation — "(see Sanchez 2009, 25)" — *and* an Obsidian wikilink to that source’s literature note. Other citation plugins can either link to a literature note (`[[@sanchez2009]]`) or render pandoc-formatted citations (`[see @sanchez2009, p. 25]`), preventing you from integrating publication-ready citations as nodes in Obsidian's note network visualized in backlinks and graphs.

Beyond linking your scholarly notes and references, ScholarWeft links your writing inside Obsidian to the world beyond Obsidian. Import DOCX and ODT documents as Obsidian notes, converting their Zotero citations to linked citations and importing a literature note for each cited work. Export an Obsidian note or compile a series of notes as a publication-ready DOCX, ODT, or PDF document with functioning citations — so you can do all your academic writing inside manageable, interlinked Obsidian notes, even long book projects.

This plugin started as a fork of [Bripey Citation Suite](https://github.com/112345brian/bripey-citation-suite), a descendant of [Pandoc Reference List](https://github.com/community-archive/obsidian-pandoc-reference-list). It was renamed to reflect its more comprehensive and unique combination of functions.

## Features

Most features work with **no external tools** (no Pandoc, no Zotero) when you use a bibliography file. The ones that don't note it inline; see [Dependencies](./docs/dependencies.md) for details.

### Citations

- **Linked citations** — `[[@smith1992|see @, p. 6]]` → (see Smith 1992, 6): real Obsidian wikilinks *and* publication-ready formatted citations. See [Linked Citations](./docs/linked-citations.md).
- **Full references in the text** — `[[@key|reference]]`, or a container such as `[ [[@a|reference]] [[@b]] [[@c]] ]`, inserts the formatted bibliography entry (or a list of them) — for reading lists and syllabi. They render live in Obsidian and export as plain formatted text. See [Inserting full references](./docs/linked-citations.md#inserting-full-references).
- **Conventional pandoc citations** — `[@key]`, `[see @key, p. 25]` render too, and commands convert between formats losslessly.
- **Live reference sidebar** — a searchable list of every citation in the current note, with copy and jump buttons.
- **Insert bibliography at cursor** and **bibliography snapshot** (save a note's citations as a `.bib`, colour-coded by sync status).
- **Citekey autocomplete and full-text search** — `@` searches citekeys (prefix → substring → fuzzy), `@@` searches titles/authors across your library.
- **Smart bracket insertion** — `⌘↵` wraps the selection in `[@key]` without double-wrapping.
- **Diacritic-insensitive search** — "Muller" finds "Müller".
- **Citation decoration and tooltips** — colour-coded status; hover for a formatted preview, literature-note link, and Zotero link.
- **Mobile support** — tap citations in reading mode, long-press in the editor. See [Mobile](./docs/mobile.md).

### References and literature notes

- **Import and update from Zotero** — pick one or more references in Zotero's native dialog and create or refresh their notes; update the current note, or every note in the vault, in place. Re-imports update only the managed annotations region and metadata, leaving your own writing untouched.
- **Literature note creation** — create notes for cited works from the sidebar, tooltip, or command palette. ScholarWeft's default template provides comprehensive bibliographic data in the note’s frontmatter and rich annotation callouts. See [Literature Notes](./docs/literature-notes.md).
- **Multiple bibliography sources** — any number of `.bib`/CSL-JSON/CSL-YAML files plus Zotero, merged; Zotero wins on conflicts. See [Bibliography](./docs/bibliography.md).
- **Native Zotero 7/8 API** — no Better BibTeX needed to resolve and format citations (BBT still required for Zotero 6, and still the easiest way to auto-generate citekeys). See [Zotero](./docs/zotero.md).
- **Citekey sync** — update citations and literature notes across the vault if your citekeys change; images attached from annotations are also renamed.

### Document import and export (desktop only)

- **Compile and export** a note or a multi-note outline as markdown, DOCX, ODT, or PDF with one command, with fine-grained options (TOC, footnotes or endnotes, figure captions, custom styles). See [Document Import and Export](./docs/import-export.md).
- **Import DOCX/ODT** documents as markdown notes, converting their Zotero citation fields to linked citations.
- **Standard Obsidian and custom callouts and markdown → DOCX/ODT/PDF styles** — Markdown Attributes / Extended Markdown Syntax styles are converted automatically; styles undefined in the template get a highlighted sentinel style so you can easily locate and define them.

### Requirements at a glance

Basic citation work needs nothing installed. Document import/export and live Zotero fields require installing some combination of Python 3, Pandoc, Zotero/Better BibTeX, LibreOffice, and/or a LaTeX distribution — see **[Dependencies](./docs/dependencies.md)** for the exact mapping and download links. The plugin detects what is installed and greys out options that can't run.

## Install via BRAT

1. Disable Restricted Mode, then install and enable [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) from the Community Plugins list.
2. In BRAT's settings, add `nebedaay/ScholarWeft` to the **Beta plugin list**.
3. Enable **ScholarWeft** in Community Plugins. BRAT keeps it updated.

**New to all of this?** **[Setup](./docs/setup.md)** is a complete, click-by-click walkthrough, and it opens with a **setup script** that can do the whole thing for you — install/update the Obsidian and Zotero apps, add ScholarWeft to Obsidian and Better BibTeX to Zotero, switch on Zotero's local connection, and install the document tools (Python, Pandoc, LibreOffice, LaTeX, fonts). It is interactive (asks before each step), safe to re-run, and prints a summary of what succeeded/failed/was skipped. Copy the one-line command for your OS from the top of [Setup](./docs/setup.md#the-easy-way-run-the-setup-script).


## Companion plugins

ScholarWeft creates and refreshes literature notes itself — no companion plugin is required. If you already use [ZotLit](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-zotlit), you can switch the import path to ZotLit under **Settings → ScholarWeft → Literature note import**. ScholarWeft’s `@@` autocomplete draws on ZotLit's full-text database whenever it is present. Neither plugin requires the other.

**One-click ZotLit templates:** If you select ZotLit, *Settings → ScholarWeft → "Install and use ScholarWeft's ZotLit import templates"* copies ScholarWeft’s Zotero import templates into `sw-zotlit-templates/` to yield literature notes similar to those generated when using ScholarWeft’s own import path. This leaves your own templates untouched. It also applies ScholarWeft's **frontmatter field mappings** to your ZotLit settings, since ZotLit builds note frontmatter from its settings, not from the templates. See [ZotLit Import Templates](./docs/zotlit-import-templates.md).

## Plugin API

```ts
const plugin = app.plugins.plugins["scholar-weft"] as { api?: ScholarWeftApi } | undefined;
if (plugin?.api?.version === 1) {
  await plugin.api.focusReferenceListView();
  const citekeys = await plugin.api.getCitekeysForFile(app.workspace.getActiveFile() ?? undefined);
}
```
